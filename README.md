# hello-world
My first repository.... or is it? It is. 


My name is Sarah. I am learning web-development. I am excited to be in this field and try to make progress as often as possible, but I must admit it is a challenge not to compare myself to people who are so much further along in their education and  in their career. I have found with this community, however, that there are so very many "helpers"; people who devote their time and energy to helping others along in their journey. Mr. Rogers would be proud. Anyway, back to the learning.
